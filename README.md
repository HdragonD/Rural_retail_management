# Rural_retail_management
This is a project on which I have personally invested some time and energy for collection to data which is included in this.
The data used in this project is partially authentic and partially AI generated.
For the safety of the real people, I have mixed the data so that it can not be identified.
Here I have run 10 queries which I thought were most useful in order to gain meaningful insights from the data.
I hope this helps anyone who is interested in retail business analytics.
Until next time ...
